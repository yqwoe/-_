# Friday Theme

## A Bootstrap 4 portfolio and blog theme for Jekyll

* Example 1: This repo builds directly to GitHub pages: https://sfreytag.github.io/yqwoe.github.io/
* Example 2: my own homepage, http://www.freytag.org.uk
* Docs: https://sfreytag.github.io/yqwoe.github.io/projects/install.html

The theme is free to use, but if you do use it, it would be great to hear from you. Email simon@freytag.org.uk - thanks!
